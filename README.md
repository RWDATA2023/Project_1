# High Demand and Low Supply: A Snapshot of DC Housing

---

Housing has persisted as one of DCâ€™s most challenging social issues to navigate. Using a dataset from July 2018 containing detailed characteristics of over 150,000 residential properties in DC, this project will explore various aspects of the DC housing market to explain what are some of the driving factors behind major market trends. An depth analysis of this data yielded the following key insights:

- The average DC residence is 78 years old which means it has hit the limit of the average life expectancy for a home.
- The larger socioeconomic disparities of DC persist in the housing market as well with housing conditions in wards east of the river generally being worse than that of Northwest DC.
- The disparity is also expressed in contrasting home values of Wards 7 & 8 homes against the prices of central and Northwest DC wards.
- Living space is a highly demanded commodity in the District with home price expected to increase by $4,418 for every 100 square feet of living space.
